      "overview": "- Prediction agent successfully deployed on Olas network after 1.5 hours of extensive configuration; runs asynchronously 1-2 times daily.\n- Complex token swapping process required five conversions due to ETH not being accepted; gas fees account for approximately 8% of total funds.\n- Custom agents cannot be adjusted for database comparison projects; two strategies identified for future exploration: quality scoring and preference prediction.\n- Primary focus on agent registration and deployment setup, requiring further research on custom creation; Vardhan to report findings next meeting.\n- Plan to create eight databases (2x2x2) using all papers from two shared Google Drive folders to demonstrate system capabilities.\n- Fixed-length chunking recommended to avoid formatting issues; pending verification of token limits for 'no chunking' option.\n- Joe and Andrew rescheduled meeting from today to tomorrow at 7am; Vardhan to request a more suitable time.\n- Gradio UI framework suggested as a new interface to address ongoing issues; public AI benchmarked with $8M Series A funding and $14M revenue.\n- Laura approved funding for hiring an automated scientist developer via Athena DAO tokens; Vardhan tasked to find a candidate by week's end.\n- Database sharing solution needed, weighing options between shared beta account and manual transfer method.",

      "overview": "- Payment processing for VAR meta review is pending; Levi must verify invoice updates before authorizing payment for completed development work.\n- Nakib's progress on TCP/IP implementation has been slower than expected due to part-time hours; improvement anticipated as he shifts focus next semester.\n- Phala offers robust internal Ethereum key management with on-chain verification, while Oasis lacks cross-chain support; job format specs for TE implementation are needed.\n- Proposed three-tier service architecture will consist of service providers, database maintainers, and end users, with payment to providers in USDC for computational tasks.\n- Partnership meeting with Near AI to explore collaborative opportunities in Trusted Execution Environments, particularly in model training.\n- Hiring plans initiated for developing agent communication infrastructure, emphasizing separation of the communication layer from execution modules, with a two-month implementation timeline.\n- New 'commenter' primitive will enable parallel job execution and may require assessment of impacts on existing contract structures for modular composition.\n- A simple hash-based storage solution was proposed for file management; IPFS identified as the preferred option for exotic storage needs.\n- Focus on completing a comprehensive roadmap by year-end; Yang will document findings on the commenter primitive's implementation feasibility.\n- Coordination is required across multiple parallel development tracks to ensure alignment and progress on technical architecture initiatives.",
