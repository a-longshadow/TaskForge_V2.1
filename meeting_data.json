      "short_summary": "Andrew and Joe prepared for the Levy meeting to assess project progress and address action items from the previous meeting on the 9th. They highlighted the successful migration from N8N to a custom web application, which improves storage and supports human-in-the-loop editing before integration with Monday.com. A new manual categorization feature on the dashboard enhances action item classification without integration issues. Joe pointed out three technical challenges, particularly column mapping with Monday.com. The team is implementing a GitHub-first strategy to ensure version control and prevent destructive coding practices. Three main deliverables for the Levy meeting include the redesign of the N8N flow, integration with Monday.com, and Discord connectivity. The custom web application provides manual control for meeting transcription, and Levy will be able to modify prompts through an admin interface, simplifying workflows. The meeting was rescheduled to 3 PM, and the team expressed confidence in the project despite existing challenges.",
